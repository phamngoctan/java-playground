# java-playground
java-playground project to test, to play round all the concerns about:
 - java core
 - data structures
 - algorithms

*Because this repository just reflects the view of author, please feedback me via email phamngoctan.com@gmail.com if you have any concerns*.

# how to run
mvn clean test

# Data structures
## Vector
## LinkedList
## Queue
## Stack
## HashTable
This implementation follows this tutorial https://dzone.com/articles/custom-hashmap-implementation-in-java  
It includes:
 - hash(k, m) - m is size of hash table
 - add(key, value) - if key already exists, update value
 - exists(key)
 - get(key)
 - remove(key)
 - capacity() //testing purpose
 - size() //testing purpose
 
Notes:  
 - support null key
 - in Java 8, to improve the performance of HashMap, put() methodâ€™s implementation has been updated to use a Red Black Tree if there are more than 8 Entries in the same bucket.
 - having more than one Entry in a bucket is called Hash Collision and the Linked list approach to contain Entries with same hash values in the same bucket is called chaining.
 - consider implementing the capacity as a prime number, this can prevent the collision better (https://web.archive.org/web/19990903133921/http://www.concentric.net/~Ttwang/tech/primehash.htm).
 - why the remove method checks if the size = current_capacity / 4 to do the re-index? Because it would prevent the situation that someone adds one more item at the increasing_point. Then, he/she again deletes item at the decreasing_point. This would make the add/remove O(n) always. At least, divide for 4 would prevent that.
 
## Binary search
Add implementation for binary search using:
 - recursive approach
 - while loop

## Binary search tree
Idea of deleting a Node, we separates it into three cases:
 - the deleting node is a leave, keep the previous node and just set its pointer to null
 - the deleting node is root but it has only a child. Get its child and use the previous node point to its child. Done.
 - the deleting node is root with two children. Find the smallest right child Node data, put it to the deleting node data. Finally, remove the smallest right node.

# Multi-threads
## Sleep
## Join
## Wait
## Yield
## Thread deadlock
Don't run it on any online IDE.  
Just run it on our local machine.  
To trace the deadlock, we can use JMC (java mission control) or JVisualVM in bin folder of our JDK installation.

## Bit's complement
### Ones' complement
How to calculate the binary of a number into it's ones' complement  
It is the same like positive number, but use the first bit to mark the number is negative or not.  
 - If the first number is 1, it is negative.
 - If it is 0, it is positive. 
Declaring a byte in java, two ways:
 - byte x = 0b10 --> 2, 0b1000 --> 8, -0b10 --> -2
 - byte x = 8 --> equivalent to 0b1000

### Two's complement
How to calculate the binary of a number into it's twos' complement  
Reverse all its bits, then plus 1 to the result of the previous reverse step

### Bit utils
 - Add absolute function of an integer variable in bit approach, the performance could be better than Math.abs. But only use it when you really need to improve the performance of the system.
 - Add fetch bit at a position from an integer
 - Check if a given number is a power of 2
 - Find missing pair item of a given array
 - Find the number of set bits in a binary representation of a number
 - Swap two integers
 - Kernighan's Bit Counting (**really cool idea**)
