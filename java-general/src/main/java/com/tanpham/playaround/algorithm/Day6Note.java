/**
 * Stack is a tool to discard the recursive
 * DFS NOT SURE it can find the shortest way of two edges
 * 
 * O(V + E) even one loop inside another loop
 * V: so canh
 * E: so dinh
 * 
 * Recursive vs Stack: they are different in the result. But we have to study both of them, in some case, 
 * recursive will make the code easier to understand
 * Both approaches cost the same time complexity O(V + E)
 * 
 * How to apply:
 * Download data 99% -> DFS (cannot resume)
 * Torrent, pier to pier: (you can pause or even lost the connection, you can resume after all)
 * 
 * Topo sort
 * Maxflow: su dung toi da(chuyen bay), canh bao toi da(ket xe)
 * 
 * even that is the shortest way, maybe it not a good way (ket xe =)) )
